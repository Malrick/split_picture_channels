## Splitting channels from a picture 

This repository is a starter exercise for students learning how to work with GitHub.

It opens a picture with [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and separates the three channels. 

All three resulting images are stored to the folder <i>/output/</i>.

### Step 1: Cloning the repository

Once you have configured [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), it is very easy to get the code on your machine.

To do that you need to: 

1. Click on the green button at the top right
2. Select the URL that you see there (https://github.com/Malrick/split_picture_channels.git)
3. Open Git Bash in the folder of your choice
4. Type the command "git clone https://github.com/Malrick/split_picture_channels.git"

This commands allow you to have the project set up on your machine. 

### Step 2: Opening the project in PyCharm

Now that you have a project that has been saved somewhere on your machine, you can use PyCharm to open this project and look at the different files in it. 

### Step 3: Install the dependency

If you're working in Python, you'll often find yourself working with pieces of code that you didn't write. In order to install them, the most popular tool is [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/). 

This repository requires you to install the package Pillow. To do so, you will need to run the command <i>"pip install pillow"</i> in a terminal. 

There's no need to install other packages. 

### Step 4: Play around and understand the code

This code is using PIP to manipulate a picture. Here, the operation that is done is quite easy (splitting channels), but many more things are possible.

You could: 
- Display informations about the media
- Resize the picture
- Crop it
- Apply transformations
- ...

Feel free to play around and try to get familiar with the library.
